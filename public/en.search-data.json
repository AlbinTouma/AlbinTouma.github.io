As an International Affairs Research Analyst at Comply Advantage, I help build the screening platforms that compliance officers use.\nWhat motivated me to start Illicit Finance was the challenge of collecting data and exposing networks.\nI first experienced the complexity of illicit finance when building a global database of sanctioned entites and politically exposed persons, Know Your Sanctions. This side project quickly grew into different research projects on how illicit funds are used, but I withheld from publishing.\nIn light of Russia’s resource grab in Ukraine, I joined OSINT for Ukraine as an investigator documenting war crimes with a focus on illicit funds.\nAfter working on tools to support investigations in Ukraine, I decided it was time to publish findings in “Illicit Finance” as a way to collate investigations and share them with a broad audience of readers.\nFeel free to reach out to me on albin.touma@gmail.com"},"title":"About Illicit Finance"}}
